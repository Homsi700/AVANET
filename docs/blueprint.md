## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Moderate blue (#5DADE2), balancing technical precision with approachability, reminiscent of clear skies and calm seas. Not literally referencing anything; this is intended for vibe.
- Background color: Very light blue (#EBF5FB), providing a clean and unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: Blue-green (#48C9B0), an analogous color that offers enough chromatic contrast to be clearly distinguished from the primary blue. It is also reminiscent of technological communications, so will reinforce that vibe in the UI.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font known for its modern, neutral design suitable for both headlines and body text, offering excellent readability on screens.
- Simple, line-based icons for device statuses, connection types, and management actions.
- A clean, modular layout with cards for each device, making key metrics easily accessible.
- Subtle transitions for device status changes and data updates.
